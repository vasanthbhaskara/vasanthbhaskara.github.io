I'm a Research Engineer at [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/) Montreal working on Foundation Models and LLMs for Finance. 

Previously, I was a Research Engineer at [Samsung AI Center Toronto](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_toronto) working with [Dr. Alex Levinshtein](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~babalex/) and [Prof. Allan Jepson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jepson/) on Computer Vision, specifically, Burst Photography, Neural Implicit Models, Image Enhancement and Synthesis. Earlier, I was a Software Engineer developing Behavior-based  Malware Classifiers using Machine Learning for [Norton AntiVirus](https://us.norton.com/) at [Symantec Corporation](https://www.broadcom.com/products/cybersecurity) in Pune, India.

I'm interested in fundamental research on deep learning for computer vision, and applied AI for healthcare and medicine.

I graduated with a Master's from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto in 2020 focusing on Deep Learning for Computer Vision. During this period, I received the Vector Institute Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence (VSAI) that was awarded to 66 graduate students across the province of Ontario, Canada. In 2016, I graduated from IIT Guwahati with a B.Tech. in Engineering Physics and received the Institute Silver Medal for the best academic performance in the department.
