Aspiring Software Engineer/Data Scientist with a deep affinity for Computer Science and Machine Learning. I bring a robust foundation in Mathematics, Computational skills, and Engineering acumen honed during my bachelor's program at the esteemed National Institute of Technology (NIT), Calicut.

Proficient in Algorithms, Machine Learning, Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus, and adept at utilizing programming languages such as C/C++, Python, and SQL. My toolkit includes mastery of data science libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, and OpenCV.

I was the recipient of the prestigious [Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) Fellowship](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2023/lists/selectedList.jsp), awarded to the top 200 students from premier institutes in India across all the Engineering disciplines. 

Last Summer, I worked at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru</a> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dashresearchlab/people" target="_blank">Multiscale Transport and Energy Research (MTERL) Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/people/susmita-dash/" target="_blank">Dr. Susmita Dash</a>, as an Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellow. <br>
