I'm a Research Engineer at Borealis AI in Montreal working on Foundation Models and LLMs for financial applications. Previously, I was at Samsung AI Centre in Toronto working with Dr. Alex Levinshtein and Prof. Allan Jepson on Computer Vision, specifically, Burst Photography, Neural Implicit Models, Image Enhancement and Synthesis. And before that, I worked on Malware Classification using machine learning for Norton AntiVirus at Symantec Corporation in Pune, India.

I graduated with a Master's from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto in 2020 focusing on Deep Learning for Computer Vision. During this period, I received the Vector Institute Scholarship in Artificial Intelligence (VSAI) that was awarded to 66 graduate students across the province of Ontario, Canada. In 2016, I graduated from IIT Guwahati with a B.Tech. in Engineering Physics and received the Institute Silver Medal for the best academic performance in the department.
