I'm a final year student at the [National Institute of Technology (NIT), Calicut](https://www.nitc.ac.in/) majoring in [Mechanical Engineering](https://nitc.ac.in/department/mechanical-engineering).  

I was the recipient of the prestigious [Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS) Fellowship](https://webjapps.ias.ac.in/fellowship2023/lists/selectedList.jsp), awarded to the top 200 students from premier institutes in India across all the Engineering disciplines. 

Last Summer, I worked at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru</a> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dashresearchlab/people" target="_blank">Multiscale Transport and Energy Research (MTERL) Lab</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://mecheng.iisc.ac.in/people/susmita-dash/" target="_blank">Dr. Susmita Dash</a>, as an Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellow. <br>

- Conducted experiments involving water droplets on a hot pillared surface and captured dynamics using high-speed cameras
- Conducted image processing in Python using OpenCV on the clip of a Leidenfrost droplet
- Gained proficiency in the principles of image processing algorithms: Gaussian Blur, Canny Detector, Thresholding, and Contouring
- Quantified the effect of an increase in heat transfer from the pillars to the droplet with pillar height, by modelling the system as fins
