abstract = {We propose and numerically simulate two methods for implementing Bragg gratings in hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers. These two methods leave the hollow-core unobstructed and both are based on controlled selective injection of photosensitive polymers into the photonic-crystal region of the hollow-core fiber, followed by interference photolithography. We report the results of numerical simulations for the hollow core fiber with Bragg gratings formed by the two methods. We find that a reflectivity of \&\#x0003E; 99.99\&\#x00025; should be achievable from such fiber-integrated mirrors.},
